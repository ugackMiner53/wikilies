# Wikipedia Lies
*Inspired by [The Technical Difficulties](https://www.techdif.co.uk/)' [Two Of These People Are Lying](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfx61sxf1Yz2I-c7eMRk9wBUUDCJkU7H0) series.*

## How To Play
You can either create a new lobby or join an existing one on the homepage, as long as you enter your username first.

Once you're in a lobby, you'll be prompted to pick an article at the top right.  
Clicking on this will open the article browser, and prompt you with five random articles.  
You can then click on any of them to read the text of the article.  
If you don't like any of the random ones, click "Show Random Articles" to get five new articles!  
Have a specific article in mind? Use the searchbar to jump directly to any article you type in!

Use the "Select This Article" button to confirm your article choice and be taken back to the lobby screen.

As the host of the lobby, you have the power to choose who will be judging, which can be done by clicking on their name.
Their name should become bold and gain the text "(Judging)" afterwards.

Once the game starts, one player's article will be chosen at random, and everyone will need to tell the judge what the article is about.
However, because some players obviously haven't read the article, only one person is telling the truth, and everyone else is lying!

As the judge, you then need to figure out who is telling the truth, and as a player, you need to convince the judge that you're telling the truth (even if you haven't read the article!)

After each round, a results screen will show, and the person whose article was picked will be prompted to go and choose a new article.
